# Homework0
Write a programme with the following functionality:
Pass a string (we will assume it is some standard document number in a given format) as input.
The document number has the format xxxx-yyyy-xxxxx-yyyy-xyxyxy, where x is any digit and y is a letter of the Latin alphabet (can be large and small).
	- Print the first two blocks of 4 digits on one line.
	- Display the document number, but replace blocks of three letters with *** (each letter will be replaced with *).
	- Display only one letter of the document number in the format yyy/yyyy/y/y/y in lower case.
	- Display letters from the document number in the format "Letters:yyy/yyyy/y/y/y/y" in uppercase (implement using StringBuilder class).
	- Check if the document number contains the sequence "abc" and display the message whether it does or not (abc and ABC are considered to be the same sequence).
	- Check if the document number starts with the sequence 555.
	- Check if the document number ends with the sequence 1a2b.
Implement all these methods in a separate class in static methods, each task in a separate method.
The methods will take as input (as an input parameter) the string input to the programm.
